# Zeta Note 

_Delightful note taking in markdown..._

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/artempyanykh/zeta-note/actions/workflows/push.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/artempyanykh/zeta-note/actions/workflows/push.yml)

**2023 Update: I've opened this to slowly integrate zetanote into another existing project.**

**THIS PROJECT IS RETIRED:**
Zeta Note has been retired as I don't have enough free time to continue
development in Rust. The product however lives on, and is [developed in F# under
the name `marksman`](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman).

Zeta Note is a language server that helps you write and manage notes. The
primary focus is to support [Zettelkasten-like][zettel-wiki]<sup>[1](#fn1), [2](#fn2)</sup> note
taking by providing an easy way to **cross-reference notes** (see more about
features below).

But you don't have to go all-in on Zettelkasten method to benefit from Zeta Note:
1. Write your notes that way you like.
2. Cross-reference notes using _reference_ links:
   - `[:another-note]` - a reference to another note.
   - `[:another-note@##Subsection]` - a reference to a subsection of a note.
   - `[:@##Inner subsection]` - a reference to a subsection of the current note.

   Auto-completion provided by Zeta Note makes this process quick and easy.
3. **Go To Definition**, **Hover** preview, **Code Lenses**, and
   **Diagnostics** simplify navigating and maintaining notes.

## Existing editor integrations<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>:

- VSCode via [Zeta Note VSCode][zn-vscode].
- Neovim 0.5+ via [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/CONFIG.md#zeta_note).

## How to install

### Option 1: via `cargo install`

Given you have Rust and Cargo installed, run 
```
cargo install zeta-note
```

The binary will be built and installed under a local Cargo folder (usually, `$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

### Option 2: use pre-built binary

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/artempyanykh/zeta-note/releases) page: each release has pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Download the binary for your OS.
2. Rename the binary and make it executable:
    * MacOS: `mv zeta-note-macos zeta-note && chmod +x zeta-note`
    * Linux: `mv zeta-note-linux zeta-note && chmod +x zeta-note`
    * Windows: rename `zeta-note-windows.exe` to `zeta-note.exe`.
3. Place the binary somewhere in your `PATH`. 
    * XDG recommends using `$HOME/.local/bin/` (make sure this folder is in your `PATH`).

### Option 3: build from source
0. Install Rust and Cargo via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/artempyanykh/zeta-note.git`
2. Inside `zeta-note` folder run `cargo install --path .`
3. The binary will be installed under `$HOME/.cargo/bin` (make sure this folder is in your `PATH`).

<span id="fn1">\[1\]</span>: You may have heard about [Roam Research][roam]. This is a commercial
implementation of the Zettelkasten method and another point of reference for
what Zeta Note is about. However, unlike a proprietary Roam Research, Zeta
Note is free, open-source and integrated into your favourite editor (albeit
for not not as feature rich as Roam Research).

<span id="fn2">\[2\]</span>: There is an excellent VSCode extension called [Markdown
Memo][md-memo]. You definitely need to check it out if you're primarily using
VSCode as it has some features that are missing in Zeta Note and [Zeta Note
VSCode extension][zn-vscode]. However, Markdown Memo is VSCode specific while
Zeta Note is a generic language server, so can be used with any editor that
has LSP support: Emacs, Vim, Neovim, etc.

<span id="fn3">\[3\]</span>: Since Zeta Note is a regular Language Server most of the functionality
works out of the box with any LSP client. The only thing that requires custom
handling is "Code Lenses" due to how these are defined in LSP spec.

<span id="fn4">\[4\]</span>: [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) was a huge
source of inspiration for how to implement various parts of an LSP server in Rust. Thank you!
